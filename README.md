## 💡 The Problem
Most engineering students send generic "Please hire me" emails that get ignored. Recruiters receive hundreds of identical applications daily. **Forge** solves this by using LLMs to map a student's specific technical wins (projects, hackathons, open-source) directly to the specific pain points identified in a Job Description (JD).

## ✨ Key Features
* **🔍 Gap Analysis Engine:** Automatically compares your current skill set against the JD to identify "high-signal" talking points you might have missed.
* **🏗️ Proof-of-Work Mapping:** Connects your personal projects (like ML models or Web Apps) directly to the company’s tech stack.
* **📧 Follow-up Strategist:** Generates a value-based follow-up sequence (Day 3 and Day 7) to keep you on the recruiter's radar without being intrusive.
* **🎭 Tone Architect:** Instantly switch styles between "Agile Startup" (direct/impactful) and "Structured Corporate" (formal/reliable).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **LLM Engine:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (via Google AI Studio)
* **Framework:** Next.js / Node.js
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Deployment:** Google Cloud Run

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* A Gemini API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)

### Local Installation
1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Forge-AI-Outreach.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Forge-AI-Outreach.git)
    cd Forge-AI-Outreach
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API key:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
4.  **Launch the app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1.  **Input:** Paste the target Job Description and your LinkedIn profile/Resume text.
2.  **Analyze:** The engine identifies technical "hooks" based on your project history.
3.  **Generate:** Receive a customized outreach draft along with a **Strategy Note** explaining why specific parts of your background were highlighted.
